# Rules

- Use prettier format code.

- Components: always have index.js
- Component-specific view model must be defined right next to the component.
- Use lower case for directory and file name, e.g. scale-unit.js.
- Service must be a class. Can export instance.
- Avoid hard code colors
- No inline style
- Define function outside component: ( avoid define new function inside function component )
- index.ts
